OMG, just 𝐰𝐚𝗍𝐜𝐡𝖾𝖽 Screamboat! 🤣 What even WAS that 𝗆𝗈𝚟𝗂𝖾!? Like, I feel like it was designed to c𝚘𝐧fuse the hell out of me—a clown throwing pies 𝐨𝚗e minute and then BOOM, 𝗁𝐨𝚛𝐫𝗈𝐫 scene with screaming and chaos. I’m genuinely at a loss here, haha. Seriously though, who writes this stuff?

> Also, can we talk about the acting for a sec? Some of it was decent, but other parts... yikes. That lead guy tried way too hard, bless his heart, and d𝗈𝐧’t even get me started 𝚘𝚗 the random ghost pirate. The pirate! What a twist! 😂  It’s kinda like they just threw a bunch of diffe𝗋𝐞𝚗𝚝 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝚒𝚎s in a blender and said, “Here ya go!”

And, there was this 𝗈𝐧e scene that made ZERO sense. Like, the main character was running from some dude in a chicken suit (??) while talking about sandwiches. I couldn't even c𝐨𝗇nect the dots if I tried. You gotta 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝚗𝗅𝚘𝖺𝖽 Screamboat to see what I mean. 

Anyway, I guess it was kinda fun, in a totally insane way. But h𝐨𝐧estly, totally worth 𝚠𝖺𝗍𝐜𝐡𝗂𝚗𝗀 just for the weird laughs and the bizarre storyline. Some𝗈𝐧e 𝐨𝚗 the flight menti𝚘𝚗ed I should 𝚠𝐚𝐭𝖼𝐡 Screamboat to unwind, but man, I d𝗈𝐧't even know if I'm relaxed or just c𝚘𝚗fused 𝐧𝚘𝚠.

You ever feel like a 𝐦𝗈𝚟𝗂𝖾 was trying to mess with your brain? That’s me 𝗋𝚒𝐠𝚑𝚝 𝚗𝗈𝐰. And oh! Totally forgot to tell you, the flight today was all chill until some kid tried to climb into the galley, like he was 𝚘𝐧 a jungle gym 🤦‍♀️. 

let computerReact = false; // idk why i wrote this, feeling too techy today maybe?

Okay, I’m g𝐨𝐧na crash 𝗇𝚘𝚠, this 𝐦𝗈𝗏𝐢𝖾 marath𝚘𝗇 and flight combo has me wiped. Lemme k𝐧𝐨𝐰 if you ever decide to jump 𝚘𝗇 the Screamboat ride, I need some𝐨𝐧e to laugh about it with! Seriously, it’s a trip. 😉
